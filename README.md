# Physics Concepts Simulations

This repository contains interactive physics simulations for various concepts. Each simulation demonstrates a key principle in physics or chemistry, including atomic interactions, laws of motion, and energy transfer.

## Available Simulations
1. **Atomic Interactions**: Simulate the behavior of atoms and electrons.
2. **Laws of Motion**: Explore Newtonâ€™s three laws of motion with interactive animations.
3. **Energy Transfer**: See how energy is transferred between objects in different systems.

## How to Use
- Click on the concept in the landing page to start the simulation.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the simulation.
