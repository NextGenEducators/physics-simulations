# Physics Concepts Simulations

This repository contains interactive physics simulations for various concepts. Each simulation demonstrates a key principle in physics or chemistry, including atomic interactions, laws of motion, and energy transfer.

## Available Simulations
1. **[Elastic Collision of Two Blocks](https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/elastic-collision)**: Visualize and interact with the elastic collision of two blocks with different masses. This simulation demonstrates the conservation of momentum and energy in an ideal elastic collision.

## How to Use
- Click on the concept in the landing page to start the simulation.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the simulation.
